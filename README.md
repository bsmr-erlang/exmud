# Eden
A text based mud engine.

This is just the core engine without the functionality to interface with actual users. It is designed to be embedded in other Elixir applications which will provide the famework necessary to communicate with the end users as well as maintain and authenticate accounts and associated sessions.

WARNING: Currently in prototyping phase and is likely to be horribly broken more often than not. Expect things to change often and dramatically.
