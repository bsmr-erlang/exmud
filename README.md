# Eden
A text based interactive fiction engine.

This is just the core engine without the functionality to interface with actual users. It is designed to be embedded in other Elixir applications which will provide the famework necessary to communicate with the end users as well as maintain and authenticate accounts and associated sessions.

WARNING: Currently in pre-alpha stages and is a non-working prototype. Expect things to change often and dramatically.
